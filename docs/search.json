They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007.

The control group received a standard fundraising letter without any mention of a match.\nWithin the treatment group, match ratio, suggested donation amount, and maximum match cap were also randomized. The researchers tracked whether each recipient donated, how much they gave, and whether these outcomes varied by treatment type.

The average donation rate was about 0.42 percentage points higher for individuals who received the match offer compared to those in the control group. This result is statistically significant at the 1% level (p = 0.001), indicating strong evidence that the mention of a matching gift increases the likelihood of charitable giving. These findings align with the main result from Karlan and List (2007), Table 2A Panel A.\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm \n\nX = sm.add_constant(df_donation[\"treatment\"])\ny = df_donation[\"gave\"]\n\nprobit_model = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\nprint(probit_model.summary())\n\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

The treatment group was significantly more likely to donate, with a marginal effect estimate of approximately 0.087 (p = 0.002). This result is consistent with the linear model, but the probit specification accounts for the binary nature of the outcome and better matches Table 3, Column 1 in the Karlan and List (2007) paper. Overall, the results reinforce the conclusion that the match treatment positively influenced donation behavior.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\nmatch_only = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\n\ngave_1to1 = match_only[match_only[\"ratio\"] == 1][\"gave\"]\ngave_2to1 = match_only[match_only[\"ratio\"] == 2][\"gave\"]\ngave_3to1 = match_only[match_only[\"ratio\"] == 3][\"gave\"]\n\nt_2, p_2 = ttest_ind(gave_2to1, gave_1to1, equal_var=False)\nt_3, p_3 = ttest_ind(gave_3to1, gave_1to1, equal_var=False)\n\nprint(\"T-test: $2:$1 vs $1:$1\")\nprint(f\"T-stat = {t_2:.3f}, P-value = {p_2:.3f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"T-test: $3:$1 vs $1:$1\")\nprint(f\"T-stat = {t_3:.3f}, P-value = {p_3:.3f}\")\n\nT-test: $2:$1 vs $1:$1\nT-stat = 0.965, P-value = 0.335\n\nT-test: $3:$1 vs $1:$1\nT-stat = 1.015, P-value = 0.310\n\n\nTo test whether higher match ratios increased the likelihood of donating, I conducted two t-tests: comparing $2:$1 and $3:$1 match groups to the $1:$1 group. The results show no statistically significant difference in response rates (p = 0.335 and p = 0.310, respectively).\nThese findings support the authors‚Äô conclusion in the paper (page 8) that larger match ratios do not provide additional fundraising benefits over a standard $1:$1 match.\nI ran two t-tests to compare whether larger match ratios (e.g., $2:$1 and $3:$1) increased the likelihood of donating compared to a $1:$1 match. Both tests returned high p-values (p = 0.335 and p = 0.310), indicating that the differences were not statistically significant.\nThese results support the authors‚Äô claim in the paper (page 8) that ‚Äúlarger match ratios had no additional impact‚Äù on donation behavior. While the idea of a bigger match may seem more attractive, the data suggest that simply offering a match (even at 1:1) is enough to trigger the effect, and increasing the match does not enhance it.\nTo further examine whether higher match ratios influenced giving, I ran a linear regression using the $1:$1 match as the baseline, and included dummy variables for $2:$1 (ratio2) and $3:$1 (ratio3). The coefficients on both variables were small and not statistically significant (p = 0.338 for ratio2, p = 0.313 for ratio3). This indicates that there was no meaningful difference in the probability of donating between the different match levels. These results support the authors‚Äô observation that larger match ratios had no additional impact beyond the base $1:$1 match.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\ndf[\"gave\"] = df[\"gave\"].fillna(0)\nmatch_only = df[df[\"treatment\"] == 1].copy()\n\nmatch_only[\"ratio1\"] = (match_only[\"ratio\"] == 1).astype(int)\nmatch_only[\"ratio2\"] = (match_only[\"ratio\"] == 2).astype(int)\nmatch_only[\"ratio3\"] = (match_only[\"ratio\"] == 3).astype(int)\n\n\nreg = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3\", data=match_only).fit()\nprint(reg.summary())\nresponse_means = match_only.groupby(\"ratio\")[\"gave\"].mean()\nr_1to1 = response_means[1]\nr_2to1 = response_means[2]\nr_3to1 = response_means[3]\n\ndiff_2_vs_1 = r_2to1 - r_1to1\ndiff_3_vs_2 = r_3to1 - r_2to1\n\nprint(\"Response Rates (direct data):\")\nprint(f\"1:1 = {r_1to1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"2:1 = {r_2to1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"3:1 = {r_3to1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Difference (2:1 - 1:1) = {diff_2_vs_1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Difference (3:1 - 2:1) = {diff_3_vs_2:.4f}\")\n\n\nreg = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3\", data=match_only).fit()\nprint(reg.summary())\n\ncoef_2 = reg.params[\"ratio2\"]\ncoef_3 = reg.params[\"ratio3\"]\ndiff_coef_3_vs_2 = coef_3 - coef_2\n\nprint(\"\\nResponse Differences (from regression):\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for 2:1 vs 1:1 = {coef_2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Coefficient for 3:1 vs 1:1 = {coef_3:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Difference (3:1 - 2:1) = {diff_coef_3_vs_2:.4f}\")\n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Each point on the blue line shows the cumulative average of donation rate differences between treatment and control simulations as more observations are added. As we move toward 10,000 observations, the cumulative average stabilizes around the true difference in donation probabilities of 0.004 (shown by the red dashed line). This visual confirms the Law of Large Numbers ‚Äî with enough trials, the observed average converges to the expected value.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nn_reps = 1000\np_control = 0.018\np_treatment = 0.022\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(18, 4), sharey=True)\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = []\n    for _ in range(n_reps):\n        ctrl = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, n)\n        trt = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, n)\n        diff = trt.mean() - ctrl.mean()\n        diffs.append(diff)\n    \n    axs[i].hist(diffs, bins=30, color=\"lightblue\", edgecolor=\"black\")\n    axs[i].axvline(0, color=\"red\", linestyle=\"--\", label=\"Zero\")\n    axs[i].axvline(np.mean(diffs), color=\"black\", linestyle=\"--\", label=\"Mean\")\n    axs[i].set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    axs[i].set_xlabel(\"Avg Diff\")\n    axs[i].legend()\n\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.suptitle(\"CLT: Sampling Distribution of Mean Differences\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach panel in the histogram illustrates the sampling distribution of average differences for increasing sample sizes (n = 50 to 1000). We ran 1000 simulations per group size. As sample size increases, the distributions become more symmetric and bell-shaped ‚Äî confirming the Central Limit Theorem. With larger samples, even though the underlying distribution is Bernoulli (binary), the mean difference converges to a normal distribution. Notably, the true difference in means is clearly offset from zero, and zero lies in the tail"
